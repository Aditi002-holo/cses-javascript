### Array

Array is a container which holds a group of things in a certain way, the values are always stored in contiguous block of memory(or boxes).

Examples of an array:
- Order of learning: do you guys jump to frameworks before learning vanilla js? if you do, please don't. There is an order of learning and this also could be stuffed into an array and it would totally make sense.
- BTS Fanchant: whoa! here we go.. a BTSxARMY :] Yes, BTS has a fanchant which starts from the leader to the youngest.
- Memory in your brain: Order of your memory is always from past to present to future.

### Linked List

Linked list is like a chain where one ring connects to another. It is a linear data structure where the elements are stored in logical order rather than physical.

LL consists of one or more nodes where each node has two fields: value, link. This 'link' holds the memory address of the next node (irrespective of the place it is resided in, unlike arrays where everything has to be next to each other).

The LINKS to the respective nodes connects a list which is called a linked list.

Examples of linked list:
